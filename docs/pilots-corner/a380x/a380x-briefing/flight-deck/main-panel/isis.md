# Description

In addition to the PFD and ND, the standby instruments provide an independent source of information for:
 
- Air data and inertial reference parameters
- Navigation information.
  
The standby instruments consist of:

- Two Integrated Standby Instruments Systems (ISIS), located at the center of the instrument panel:
    - One ISIS is used as the Standby Flight Display (SFD)
    - The other ISIS is used as the Standby Navigation Display (SND).
- One standby compass.

Each ISIS can be either SFD, or SND. It is not possible to display two SFDs, or two SNDs at the same time. One SFD is 
always displayed.

Both ISIS are connected to fully independent probes:

- One standby pitot probe
- Two standby static probes.
