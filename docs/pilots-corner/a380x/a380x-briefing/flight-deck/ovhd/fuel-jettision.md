## Description

The A380's fuel jettison system is designed to quickly reduce the aircraft's weight in emergency situations, allowing it
to safely return to land. It enables the controlled discharge of fuel from specific tanks through nozzles located on the 
wings. This process helps achieve the aircraft's maximum landing weight when required, enhancing safety during emergency 
landings. The system is carefully monitored and controlled to ensure efficient and safe operation during use.
