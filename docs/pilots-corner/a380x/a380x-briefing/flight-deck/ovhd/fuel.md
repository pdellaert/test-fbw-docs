## Description

The fuel system stores fuel, monitors the quantity and temperature of fuel in each tank, and controls
fuel transfers to:

- Supply fuel to the engines and to the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU)
- Maintain the Center of Gravity (CG) within limits
- Reduce structural loads
- Control refueling and defueling
- Enable fuel jettison, if necessary.
